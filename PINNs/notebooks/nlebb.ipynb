To compute the resisual-based loss term, up to fourth-order derivatives of the FFNN are computed for the residuals.\n",

    "In the mixed formulation, the aim is to reduce the order of differentiation required during the training process with the goal of improving convergence [[1][Faroughi2023]]. This is achieved by reformulating Equations (1) and (2) into a larger system of equations with at most one order of differentiation. The following coupled system of equations is formulated:\n",
